            <h2>2a. Israel Today</h2>
            <h3>Futuristic Inventions</h3>
            <p><strong>Night Vision Lenses:</strong> These special glasses use infrared technology. Scientist Gabby Sasuri is now trying to make a special nano-material that can turn any glasses into night vision lenses.</p>
            <p><strong>Mobileye:</strong> Mobileye is an Israeli company that is in the process of designing and producing an electric car that can see and communicate with surrounding cars. The brand already has a way for the vehicle to navigate and drive without the driver's hands on the wheel. The company is hoping to eventually make the world’s first driverless car.</p>
            <p><strong>StoreDot:</strong> StoreDot solves a widespread problem worldwide: low battery on phones. Using material based on organic nanodots, StoreDot is making a charger that can charge a phone in 30 seconds.</p>
            <p><strong>Wi-Charge:</strong> Wi-Charge uses infrared technology to charge your phone. It sends out the infrared waves from a router on the ceiling. The waves are harmless to humans. This means you will be able to charge your device without it being plugged in and the charge will follow you around giving you free rein of where you are in the room and not restricting you to one spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Real View:</strong> Real View is a medical holographic display that allows doctors and surgeons to view the patient's heart in real-time. They can monitor and analyze conditions without any invasive procedures.</p>

            <h3>Ministry of Science, Technology and Space</h3>
            <p>In 1982 the Ministry of Science and Development was founded. From 1999 - 2009, the ministry changed its name and role. It became the Ministry of Science, Culture and Sport. In 2009 it once again changed and split into two Ministries, the Ministry of Culture and Sport and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space is in charge of investments in scientific research. The ministry advocates for international scientific cooperation and aims to improve research and development in Israel.</p>
            <p>They want to become ‘the leading factor in the advancement of Israel’s fields of science, technology and space as a springboard for economic growth’. They also want to make discoveries and inventions more accessible to the general public.</p>

            <h3>Israeli High-Tech Companies</h3>
            <p><strong>Mobileye:</strong> Mobileye is a car manufacturer focused on assisted and autonomous vehicles. Their priorities are safety and scalability. Mobileye was founded to address one major issue, road safety. They realized that with fewer opportunities for human/driver error, the road would be safer. So they designed a car that integrated AI and a camera/sensor to create a self-driving car. Whilst the vehicle is still not ready for public use, they are far into the journey of creating a safer future.</p>
            <p><strong>Check Point:</strong> Check Point is a global leader in cybersecurity that is trusted by customers, institutions and even governments, worldwide. They are leading the industry with a 99.8% protection rate.</p>
            <p><strong>CyberArk:</strong> CyberArk is a cybersecurity research company. They are trusted by many global organizations and businesses. They are located in 16 countries and have several regional offices around the world.</p>

            <h2>2b. History, Politics and Religion</h2>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Israel is one of the biggest tech hubs in the world. With over 4000 start-ups, this makes them the country with the second most, only topped by the United States. For thousands of years, the Jews were expelled from their homes and didn’t have allies, so they had to rely on their own wit to survive. When they finally received a homeland of their own, it was barren and with poor natural resources. The land was dry, they learned how to build water and agriculture technology. They are surrounded by enemies, they built one of the most powerful defense forces. There aren’t lots of resources, they found sustainable and unique ways around problems. Just the nature of the country and culture helps make it one of the most important technology hubs in the world.</p>

        <section id="nobel-prize-winners">
            <h2>Nobel Prize Winners</h2>
            <p><strong>Arieh Warlesh:</strong> Arieh Warlesh won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013. He was born on the 20th of November 1940 in Sde-Nahum. He studied at the Technion and ended up receiving his PhD at the Weizmann Institute in 1969. He found a way to combine classical and quantum mechanics. This can be used to calculate the movement of atoms using advanced technology.</p>
            <p><strong>Michael Levitt:</strong> Michael Levitt also won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013. He won it along with and for the same reason as Arieh Warlesh. He was born in South Africa on the 9th of May 1947. He studied Molecular Biology at Cambridge.</p>
            <p><strong>Daniel Shechtman:</strong> Daniel Shechtman was born on the 24th of January 1941 in Tel Aviv. He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2011. He got a PhD in material science at the Technion. He proved that quasicrystals exist. Quasicrystals are crystal structures that are mathematically regular but don’t repeat.</p>

            <h2>2c. IS & AUS - The Israeli-Australian Connection</h2>
            <h3>Weizmann Australia</h3>
            <p>The Weizmann Australia is a not-for-profit organization that aims to support the Weizmann Institute of Science and Technology in Israel. Thanks to them, Australia and Israel have better connections in the worldwide science industry. They also signed a partnership with the Garvan Institute. As a result of the partnership of these two organizations, they are doing joint medical research, working on cancer, diabetes, infections and autoimmune diseases. This work has led to several breakthroughs.</p>

            <h3>Technion Australia</h3>
            <p>The Technion Institute of Technology is one of the best research universities in the world. It has a very strong relationship with Australia. The Australia Technion Society was established in 1943. Their goal is to keep building connections with scientists and researchers in Australia. This allows for the creation of several research projects, partnerships and grants. This has led to amazing breakthroughs in the field of medical science, engineering and technology, which could improve the future of both nations.</p>

He became a Colonel and fighter pilot in the Air Force. In 1981 he took part in Operation Opera and was the youngest pilot. He also fought in the Yom Kippur War and Operation Peace for Galilee. He joined NASA in 1997 as a payload specialist. He trained to go to space for 5 years and logged almost 16 days of space-time. Sadly the space shuttle was destroyed and all the crew members passed away during re-entry, just 15 minutes before the scheduled landing time. He was the only non-American astronaut on the flight and one of only 2 Israelis to ever become astronauts.</p>
